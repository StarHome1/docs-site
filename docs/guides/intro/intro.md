[Binance Chain](https://www.binance.org) is a blockchain developed by [Binance](https://www.binance.com) and its community. It implements a vision of a decentralized exchange (DEX) for digital assets.

It features a highly performant distributed [matching engine](../concepts/matching-engine) that aims to replicate the <1 second matching efficiency of current centralized exchanges. Transactions burns [Binance Coin (BNB)](https://www.binance.com/en/use-bnb) according to a fee schedule.

## Functionality

Binance Chain has common functionality that most blockchains have, and in addition offers innovative features specific to the DEX and custody use case.

### Basic Features

- Sending and receiving BNB and digital assets
- Issuing new digital assets (we have a standard called BEP-2)
- Mint/burn, freeze/unfreeze, lock/unlock of digital assets

### DEX-specific features

- Propose exchange listing for trading pairs
- Creating maker/taker orders for traders
- Listing assets from other chains using [cross-chain atomic swaps](cross-chain-atomic-swaps)

### Innovation

- [Threshold Signatures](threshold-signature-scheme) (an alternative to multisig)
- Smart Contracts sidechain (in-progress)

## Participate

There are different ways to participate in the network, from light nodes to full validators.

Binance Chain embraces a philosophy of progressive decentralization, and envisions a future where BNB can be staked by organizations and individuals to participate in governance and run validator nodes.
